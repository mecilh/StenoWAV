## This whole repo is made to help me figure out DSP in Python

# I hate Python

*The code is shit, half vibecoded becasue i have no **fucking** idea how numpy works, and the whole "project" can be probably done in half the lines*;
The whole idea is to _gently_ modify some frequencies in some spaced out segements in a .wav file, adding some very low random noise, and to calculate some floats values using the IEEE 754 standard to encode 2 ASCII characters per number, to then add to 
(I HOPE) specific frequencies in order to obfuscate them and to hide some stupid messages in .wav files;

# Why?

It's Christmas time, i am bored and i have self destruction tendencies;

# How is this useful?

I don't think it's ever going to be, I'm using this to remind myself that i hate Python;

# Future plans?

I Belive that in the near future, I will sacrify my mental sanity to stop using this god forsaken language and to implement half of this stuff in C++ or do something even more stupid and start using Java to make this a serious codebase with gui (Blackjack) and shit (Hookers)
